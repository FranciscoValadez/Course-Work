yourMoney = 100      # you have 100 dollars to start.
dealerMoney = 100   # dealer also has 100 dollars to start.

print(n,"=========================================================."); n+=1; # increment n by 1
print( "Now, you have ", yourMoney, "dollars to play the game. Dealer also has ", dealerMoney, " dollars.")
bet = int(input("Enter your bet to roll 2 dice for this complete game (enter 0 to quit): "))  # convert to integer for bet

if bet == 0 :
   exit() # to stop this game and exit immediately

while True:  # keep running forever until break is encountered.
   dealer = random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6)  # dealer rolls the dice twice to get 2 numbers
   you = random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6) # you roll the dice twice to get another 2 numbers 
   print(n,"=========================================================."); n=n+1; 
   print("Roll 2 dice twice: Dealer got ", dealer , ", and you got ", you , "." )

   #Dealer wins
   if dealer > you:
       yourMoney -= bet
       dealerMoney += bet

   if dealerMoney <= 0 or yourMoney <= 0 :   # either side has no money to play
     break # time to exit the while loop and stop this game now.  Game is really over.
